# Student Management System

This is a Java backend project built with Spring Boot. It uses a PostgreSQL database to manage student data and allows for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. The project is dockerized for easy setup and deployment.

## Getting Started

To get this project up and running, follow these steps:

1. Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` to build the project and generate a .jar file.
2. Run `docker-compose up --build` to start the application.

## API Endpoints

The application provides the following endpoints:

- `GET /api/v1/students`: Fetch all students.
- `POST /api/v1/students`: Create a new student.
- `GET /api/v1/students/{email}`: Fetch a student by email.
- `DELETE /api/v1/students/{email}`: Delete a student by email.
- `PUT /api/v1/students/{email}`: Update a student by email.

## Request Body

When creating or updating a student, you should provide a JSON object with the following structure:

```json
{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe",
  "dateOfBirth": "2000-01-01",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com"
}
```

## Student Class

The Student class is the main entity of this application. It has the following fields:

- `id`: A unique identifier for each student. This is auto-generated by the database.
- `firstName`: The student's first name.
- `lastName`: The student's last name.
- `age`: The student's age. This is calculated based on the dateOfBirth and is not stored in the database.
- `email`: The student's email. This must be unique.
- `dateOfBirth`: The student's date of birth.
